"""
Minimal stub for the cgi module to satisfy dependencies (e.g., httpx) in environments
where the standard library's cgi module is removed (e.g., Python 3.12+).

Note: This stub provides only minimal functionality. If your dependencies require
more features from the cgi module, you may need to expand this implementation.
"""

def parse_header(line):
    """
    Parse a header line into a dictionary of parameters and the main value.
    This is a minimal implementation that simply returns an empty dict and the input line.
    """
    return {}, line

# You can add additional stubs or variables here if needed.
# For example, if some code requires a FieldStorage class, you might add:
class FieldStorage:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        raise NotImplementedError("FieldStorage is not implemented in this minimal stub.")

# End of minimal cgi.py stub.
